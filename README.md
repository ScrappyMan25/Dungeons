# Dungeons
Probably My Proudest Game Till Date - Dungeons is what I would consider a prototype for a dungeon crawler type game. Features Procedural Generation of Dungeons using a custom algorithm. Made on Godot in Less than a week. 

* Theme: Randomness
* Preface: Game a Week - Week 5
* Engine Used: Godot

## About 

#### Concept
This week I decided to take up a slightly challenging game design concept - Procedural generation. I spent a lot of time developing psuedocode on paper and then when I had a neat idea of how to accomplish this I was able to quite comfortably transfer the logic into GDScript. 

I went for a grid based approch to simplify the Generation process.

The point of this game is to demonstrate the room generation and the modular design to show how you could use this and add mobs - and other mechanics to this and it would work over this layer. Therefore each level the grid sizes increases by 2 to demonstrate the random generation. 

**NOTE: Dungeon gen is not maze gen**
